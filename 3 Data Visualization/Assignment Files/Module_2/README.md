#  Module 2 Overview

Purpose of this lab is to assess proficiency in utilizing R for fundamental data wrangling tasks,
which serve as a crucial skillset for upcoming data visualization tasks. 

The data for this lab can be found in
Module2.

* **Salaries.cs**

# Competencies Demonstrated
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Install and load required packages.}}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Use select(), filter(), groupby(), count() in this part and combine them with pipe operator.}}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Load the dataset using readcsv()}}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Select columns of “rank”, “discipline”, “sex”, “salary”.}}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Filter the rows where “salary” is not missing value}}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Group based on the required columns (“rank”,”discipline”, “sex”) and have the tally count of the rows}}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Reshape the table from long to wide: using spread() to split the column “sex” in the data frame. Provide values for the new columns based on “n” (tally count).}}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Reshape the table from wide to long: using gather() to make the two sex columns (from Step 6) into
one column and name the column as “sex”. Please have the values in the two columns into one
column and name the column as “n” (tally count)}}`$

**Note**:  group_by(), read_csv() will need an underscore.
