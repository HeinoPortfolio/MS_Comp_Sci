# Data description

The data used was from the Salaries.csv.  The data represents data for university teaching staff.  The data set is composed of 6 columns of data.
The data set is composed of the following columns:

- rank: This columns holds information about the position of the instructor within the university.
- discipline: This column gives a single letter code to show what discipline the instructor is in.
- yrs.since.phd: The number of years the instructor has help their PHD.
- yrs.service: The years of service or the number of years the instructor has been employed by the university.
- sex: The gender of the instructor.
- salary: The current salary of the instructor.

# Data wrangling

The data needed to be prepared before it could be processed.  The question to be answered was the count of each position grouped by rank and sex

- Step1: Remove the yrs.since.phd and yrs.service columns from the data frame.
- Step2: Filter the data to remove observations where there is no value for salary.
- Step3: Group the results from step 2 by rank, discipline, and sex.
- Step4: Count the number of observations for each of the resulting groups.
- Step5: Create a wide format for the results from step 2. Will use sex an will create two new columns Female and male that will have the counts of each.
- Step6: Using the results from the creation of the wide format, convert the wide format to a long format.
