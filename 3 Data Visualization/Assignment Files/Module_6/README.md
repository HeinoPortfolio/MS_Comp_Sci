#  Module 6 Assignment Overview

**Grouped histogram**.  

# Competencies Demonstrated
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Load the required packages}}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Set the working directory to the place where the data is stored }}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Conduct a “Grouped Histogram” based on the step mentioned below.}}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Load and inspect the dataset.}}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Break the variable “CrimeRate” into three groups based on the range and create a new variable “RangeGroup”. }}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Create two color vectors. The first color vector is obtained from  and the
second color vector is formed by colors of “green”, “blue” and “red”}}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Plot a histogram of the variable “CrimeRate” and fill with the variable “Year” using the first color vector.}}`$
- $`\textcolor{blue}{\text{Plot a histogram of the variable “CrimeRate” and fill with the variable “RangeGroup” using the secondcolor vector}}`$

**Note**: **case_when()** and **colorspace::diverge_hcl()** are used in this assignment.

The three groups will be:

- CrimeRate < 250 ~"CrimeRate < 250"
- CrimeRate >= 250 CrimeRate <= 500 ~ "250 <= CrimeRate <= 500",
- CrimeRate >500 ~"CrimeRate > 500")
