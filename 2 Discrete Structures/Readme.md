# Course Overview
The basics of discrete structures and algorithms such as relations, functions, basic logic, combinatorial techniques, sorting, searching, regular languages, and finite state automata.

This is the repository for the **Discrete Strucutures and Algorithms** course. This page will contain the coursework files that are completed during the course.  You will find sample code that was used to create the assignments and a brief description of the concepts or technology used to pass the course. 

For addititional coursework in algorithms go to my **Graphs, Algorithms and Applications** repository.  [Click Here](https://github.com/HeinoPortfolio/MS_Comp_Sci/tree/main/9%20Graphs%2C%20Algorithms%20and%20Applications)

## Note:
There were no assignments for the course that could be included in this respository. This **README** is included to give a brief synopsis of what was included in the course.
