This is a line with no person listed on it.  It should be ignored.


WALLACE: We do not want to analize the moderator, so we should ignore this line also.

(APPLAUSE)  Again, ignore everything except the two candidates BIDEN and TRUMP.

BIDEN: First Paragraph for Biden.

TRUMP: First Paragraph for Trump.

BIDEN: Second Paragraph for Biden.

WALLACE: Moderator says things, but we do not care.

This is the moderator continuing to a second paragraph.

BIDEN: Third Paragraph for Biden.

Here is another paragraph for Biden, but because it does not start with his name, we will ignore it.

TRUMP: Second Paragraph for Trump.

Likewise, these are more Trump words, but we will ignore lines that don't start with his name.

BIDEN: Fourth paragraph for Biden.

More lines to ignore!
