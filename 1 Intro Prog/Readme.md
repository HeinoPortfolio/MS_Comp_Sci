# Course Overview
Introductory software development using a high-level programming language, **Python**, for information system applications. Structured programming, data types, functions, arrays, pointers, and recursion were covered.

This is the repository for the Introduction to Programming course. This page will contain the coursework files that are completed during the course.  You will find sample code that was used to create the assignment and a brief description of the concepts or technology used to pass the course. 

# Competencies
- Identify, compare, evaluate, and write programs that use the sequencing, iteration, and selection constructs in the python programming language.
- Calculate the value of expressions and explain the effect of statements in the python programming language.
- Identify, compare, evaluate, and use the formal elements of procedural abstraction including parameters, local variables, and return values.
- Write programs that use 1- and 2-dimensional data structures to represent aggregate data and iteration to compute over the structures.

# Technologies and Concepts Used
