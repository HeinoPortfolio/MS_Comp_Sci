# Course Overview
Introductory graduate-level software development course using a high-level programming language, **Python**, for information system applications. Structured programming, data types, functions, arrays, and recursion were covered.  A course in  Python. Use of numeric and textual data. Use of data structures such as arrays, lists, sets, and dictionaries such as those implemented by hash tables.

This is the repository for the **Introduction to Programming** course. This page will contain the coursework files that were completed during the term.  You will find sample code that was used to create the assignments and a brief description of the concepts or technology used to pass the course. 

**Note:** A certificate of completion can be found on my LinkedIn page.  The certificate can be found in the Licenses & certifications section of the page. It will show my grade for the course as well as listing it as a Ball State University credential that has been applied to a master's degree.
