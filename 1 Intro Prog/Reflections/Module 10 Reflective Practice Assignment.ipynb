It is perfectly acceptable to describe trying to get something to work, and then failing to get it functioning as desired in the 20-30 min time block. This does not mean you'll get a bad grade for this assignment -- failing is a necessary part of learning, though none of us particularly enjoy it.  Sometimes what you'll try to accomplish is just too big of a task for a Reflective Practice session, and that is ok -- you will still have learned from the experience.

This was a pretty interesting reflection. Most of my errors in this assignment were typos and things of that nature. I think as I get used to using the Unicode for the emojis it will get better.  I think the major codes will be the ones that will be easy to remember. I will not have to look them up. "
