    "- It's probably a good idea to practice more regular expression use.  Have the user enter some text (something longer, copy/pasted).  Use a regular expression with re.match() to see if they entered the word \"gold\" or \"silver\".  If they did, print some silly message.  Then, run the text through the all of the TextBlob features that we learned about in this section. \n",

It is perfectly acceptable to describe trying to get something to work, and then failing to get it functioning as desired in the 20-30 min time block.  This does not mean you'll get a bad grade for this assignment -- failing is a necessary part of learning, though none of us particularly enjoy it.  Sometimes what you'll try to accomplish is just too big of a task for a Reflective Practice session, and that is ok -- you will still have learned from the experience."

    "Things of note in this reflection is to read the directions for the proper use of the function. Looking over the documentation there are a lot of feaatures in TextBlob that will be useful when analyzing text. The difficulty when using these features will be how to understand the ouputs like polarity and subjectivity.  There will be a need to research these and how these attributes can be used in future analysis. Regular expressions can be quite complex and they do not always operate like you would expect. It is best to test the expression out in the site that was given earlier. "
