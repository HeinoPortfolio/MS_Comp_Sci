| [Assignment3a.ipynb](https://github.com/HeinoPortfolio/MS_Comp_Sci/blob/main/1%20Intro%20Prog/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Assignments/Assignment3a.ipynb) | To gain familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks and simple function creation| Simple and introductory assignment that covers the basics of function use and creation.  It introduces how to use the Notebook in an the academic environment. 
|[Assignment3b.ipynb](https://github.com/HeinoPortfolio/MS_Comp_Sci/blob/main/1%20Intro%20Prog/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Assignments/Assignment3b.ipynb)|Practice defining (creating) a function, practice calling (using) a function and using interation| None
|[Assignment4.ipynb](https://github.com/HeinoPortfolio/MS_Comp_Sci/blob/main/1%20Intro%20Prog/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Assignments/Assignment4.ipynb)| Gain practice creating functions by creating two functions and integrating these functions into a single program| None
|[Assignment5.ipynb](https://github.com/HeinoPortfolio/MS_Comp_Sci/blob/main/1%20Intro%20Prog/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Assignments/Assignment5.ipynb)|A program that will loop through grades. These grades will stored in a simple list. The average of the grades willl be calculated | Makes use of a for loop |
|[Assignment6a.ipynb](https://github.com/HeinoPortfolio/MS_Comp_Sci/blob/main/1%20Intro%20Prog/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Assignments/Assignment6a.ipynb)  | Assignment to convert a string to a list of individual characters. Use the **slice()** operator to create a list that contains every other character in the original list. Functions in this program: 1. Returns an integer that represents the number of times the letter 'e' is found in a string. 2) A function that takes uses one argument and returns every other characted from that string. Function that will return a tuple that contains the only the first 5 characters in a string.   | Makes use of the  **slice()** method. |
|[Assignment6b.ipynb](https://github.com/HeinoPortfolio/MS_Comp_Sci/blob/main/1%20Intro%20Prog/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Assignments/Assignment6b.ipynb) | Practice manipulating lists. Practice using for loops with lists. Practice sorting loops. Functions in this program: 1) Functions that will append a new word as long it is not already in the list. 2) Functions accepts a list of words and returns a copy of the list with the words converted to **title case**.   | Makes use of the **title()** method. and the **sort()** method. |
|[Assignment7a.ipynb](https://github.com/HeinoPortfolio/MS_Comp_Sci/blob/main/1%20Intro%20Prog/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Assignments/Assignment7a.ipynb)|  Function that will multiply a list element by 100. Function # 2 will accomplich the same tasks as function as  the first function, but will use a **list comprehension** to accomplisth the task. | Uses a **list comprehension** and a formatted printed statement for the output.|
|[Assignment7b.ipynb](https://github.com/HeinoPortfolio/MS_Comp_Sci/blob/main/1%20Intro%20Prog/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Assignments/Assignment7b.ipynb)|First function task is to convert a string containing a Roman numeral into and integer and then return the resulting number. |Create a **dictionary**.  |
|[Assignment8.ipynb](https://github.com/HeinoPortfolio/MS_Comp_Sci/blob/main/1%20Intro%20Prog/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Assignments/Assignment8.ipynb)|Practice in using text files.  To read in text from a file and then manipulate the contents of the file. Practiced using a **dictionary**.  First function was to read in the given file and add the words to the **dictionary**.  This function counted the number of times the word appeared in the text.  | Made use of the **split()** function.  This notebook made use of the **Macbeth.txt** file that is located in the directory. |
